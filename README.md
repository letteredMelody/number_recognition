# number_recognition
This code is based on Python 2.7 and uses the classical algorithm of supervised learning with MNIST dataset. 
Presicely, files network.py and mnist_loader.py are from Michael A. Nielsen's book "Neural Networks and Deep Learning".

To test the trained network on MNIST (test), use neuro_how.py
If you want to test it on your own writing, use image_as_array.py to convert the photo to inverted b&w picture 28x28 and test it with neuro_now_your.py
